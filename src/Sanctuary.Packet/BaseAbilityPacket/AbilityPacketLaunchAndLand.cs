// Server -> client: launch a projectile and resolve its landing. The biggest ability packet by far.
//
// RECOVERED THE HARD WAY - see the notes, because this one defeated the approach that worked for the
// smaller packets:
//   * The dispatcher case (FUN_00a35cc0, case 4) calls NO deserializer. It makes a virtual call
//     (*(*this + 0xc))(), resolved at runtime by hooking the dispatcher and reading ECX->vtable:
//     vtable[0xc] = 0xa33760 (the projectile processor), which calls the real reader FUN_00a31f30.
//   * a31f30's top level is straight-line and readable (the field list below), but it ends with
//     FUN_008e8910 - a large NESTED struct whose decompilation branches, so static field extraction
//     is not trustworthy there (a linear scan reads if/else alternatives as sequential fields).
//   * The total size was therefore established EMPIRICALLY: send an oversized zero body and read the
//     reader's cursor state. Result: consumed=244, err=0 => 4 header + 240 body, and a zero-filled
//     body PARSES.
//
// So: the fields below are named because they were read directly; the nested struct is left OPAQUE
// rather than invented. Serialize() pads to the measured body size, so the packet stays the exact
// length the client expects even if a named field's width is later corrected.
//
// Field MEANINGS are unknown - the reader gives types and order only. Send the guids + Position and leave
// the rest at 0: that is the combination that is known to work.
